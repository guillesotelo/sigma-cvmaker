            `This can be our first move to make when using the app.\nSo the first thing you need to do is to make sure you have all the information you need for the CV you want to create, such as personal data from the Consultant and his/her skill set or experience, although this is not a must.\n\n\nTo begin, just go to <b>Create new CV</b> tab, take a quick look at the form, and fill it in with the information you have.\nNote that there are some required fields you must enter before making a preview or creating the CV. If some of these fields are missing, the app will let you know popping up an error message.\n\n\nThe following are some of the features you will find while creating the document:\n\n\n<b>Profile Picture with Settings<b>\nAfter clicking the profile avatar and uploading the Consultant's profile picture, you can change some of the image settings. You can open this configuration by doing a mouse-over on the picture. You will be able to change position and color values to produce the best result from the image you have.\n\n\n<b>Drag and drop items</b>\nAll the sections that beheaves as a list of items have the possibility to be edited and reorder its content. Try it yourself drag-and-dropping items like in <i>Languages</i> or <i>Skills</i>.\n\n\n<b>Hidden Sections</b>\nWhen you hover over the different sections, dropdowns or inputs, you will see an icon of an eye which represents the hidden status. With this feature you can hide information from the final PDF render. You can see the hidden sections just in Edit or Create view.\nAlso, you can hide entire blocks of information like "Expertise" or "Main Skills". To do this, just click on the minus icon (-) located in the upper-right corner of the block sections.\n\n\n<b>Sintax and Grammar Check</b>\nEvery text input is constantly being checked by a sintax and grammar AI that makes corrections and suggests you on how you can improve the spelling.\n\n\n<b>Canvas Signature</b>\nThis pad can be used to digitally sign "by hand" the document. You can let your Consultant do it later, or just hide it if you don't want to use it.\n\n\n<b>Font Sizes and Margins</b>\nBelow the signature section you'll find a little toolbar from which you can change the font size and external margins from the entire section (Personal Information in this case).\nYou'll find this toolbar in every section that can be seen in the document.\n\n\n<b>Auto-update Skill's Years</b>\nEvery time your CV completes a new year of being created, the time experience of the skills within it will be auto-updated by one year. This means you won't have to worry about doing it yourself. Note that if you edit a skill experience time manually, it will be updated one year after you did the time update.\n\n\n<b>Client Logos</b>\nIn the "Experience" section, it is possible to add a Client/Company Logo for each work experience.\nNote that you can select the Logo from a dropdown or do it mannually (it will be uploaded and will be available for others to use).\n\n\n<b>Preview Document</b>\nWith this feature, which can be activated by clicking the Preview Button on the bottom of the page, you can see how your document looks so far. If you decide that you're done and you want to export it, you need to save the CV first, then export it from the CV List which can be accessed from the left panel.\n\n\n<b>Footer Information</b>\nHere you can write the information you want to be shown in every document page's footer. You can do it manually or just by choosing a Consultant Manager from the dropdown which will auto-fill the fields with the right information.\nIt is recommended to upload the Consultant Manager data in the <i>Users</i> Section so it can be available for everyone for future uploads.\n\n\n<b>Metadata</b>\nHere is where you can select the CV Type (required) as a Master or Variant. Note that it can be only one Master type of the Consultant's CV in the system and saving Master changes will overwrite all Variants from the same Consultant. There is no creation limit for Variant CVs.\nAlso you can add buzzwords to distinguish the CV among others in search results. These words won't be shown in any view but in edit mode. Additionally, note that the search engine will look for every word within the CV, so you don't need to add words or phrases that already exists in the document.\nThe CV Note was made to make some clarification on why the CV is being created or for any other type of information that can be used for you and others to identify it. The default value will contain your name and the date the document was created.`,
